# Character Theory-crafting

### The Electrician </br></br>
##### Who are they?
The electrician is a character who ultimately remains neutral with everyone and doesn't pick any sides. They work for the City and nobody else, serving people electrical equipment (GoPros, Hacking devices, Trackers, bomb detectors). The electrician acquires their stock to sell via crafting gathered materials and decayed equipment from PD.</br>
##### Why would this character be good for the City?
The electrician would be good for the City because they have the ability to fix the power grid when it gets knocked offline. Furthermore, the electrician also has the ability to turn the power off four times per Tsunami. This can be used in tandem with gangs so they can use an inside man instead of blowing the grid up. *Yes, I know what I said about them being neutral... everyone has a price though*.

##### What skills does the electrician have/how can it be balanced?
|Skill | Balance|
|------|--------|
| Fix dead/decayed electronics equipment| Takes 5 minutes per device as a base (+1-2 minute depending on how harmful the device is eg. cameras = 5 min, Hacking device = 7 min, Tracker tool = 9 - 10 min)
| Fix power at City grid | Takes 10 minutes to fix power and requires them to drive to different sub-stations and reboot them: LSDWP Rancho Substation - little bighorn ave, Palmer-Taylor power station - Senora way |
| Turn off power at City grid | Can only be used 4 times per Tsunami and the electrician has to turn off the 2 aforementioned substations first then they can turn off power at main grid. The turning off of substations and main grid are to be done within a 15 minute window, otherwise the electrician fails and loses a use as well as being electrocuted.|
| Craft electronic devices | The electrician has to find the component parts and resources in order to craft the items. Each craft uses up the materials and also reduces no. of uses on a toolkit |

##### Steps for fixing power
A message could be displayed when 1 substation is fixed stating "An electrician has been called out and is working to fix the power"
Then a second message after the process is finished saying "The Electrician has restored the power to the city"
1. The electrician first goes to main powerstation to investigate the damage
2. Drives to 1 of the 2 substations and interacts with a terminal to boot that substation back online
    a. To get into the substation they must complete a small 3x3 or 4x4 thermite hack (to act like a keycard)
    b. Once inside they then need to interact with the terminal and complete a "connect the correct wires" minigame in order to reboot that substation (if possible, local power should be restored to the surrounding area)
3. Repeat step 2 for remaining substation
4. Returns to City grid and interacts with a button to restore full power to city

###### Fail states
- Electrician fails keycard hack to get into substation 3 times
- Electrician fails "connect the wires" minigame (Gets electrocuted and needs EMS)
- Electrician doesn't interact with power restore button after X amount of minutes after substations rebooted

##### Steps for turning off power
*Yes it could get blown up but why would he destroy his own infrastructure?*</br>
A new message could be displayed instead of "power out, working on a fix etc etc" which reads "The city's power grid is undergoing maintenance right now, We'll have it back up shortly!"
1. The electrician goes to the City grid and interacts with a terminal to get wire order for each substation
2. The electrician drives to 1 of the 2 substations
3. Does a thermite hack 3x3 or 4x4 to get inside the building
4. Uses wire cutters to cut the wires in the order received earlier
5. Repeat step 2 for remaining substation
6. Heads back to City grid and interacts with a button to turn off city power
###### Fail states
- Electrician fails to complete steps in 15 minutes
- Electrician gets wire order incorrect (Gets electrocuted and needs EMS)
- Electrician fails keycard hack to get into substation 3 times

##### Conclusion
The Electrician would be a great addition into the City as they wouldn't be short of work whether it be restoring power, taking the power offline, selling electronic equipment to people or trying to social engineer rival gangs to setup cameras in a home/territory for spying or intelligence gathering for PD. In addition to that, the Electrician would soon become a target for gangs who still decide to blow up the City grid as they would be working to try and restore the power. This could seemingly create a game of cat & mouse whilst the gang tries to prevent the Electrician from doing their job.
